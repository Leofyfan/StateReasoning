The reason is that there is no one value for the force-it changes.

Here we use the generic result of the integration.\r\n\r\nIn Figure, a cumin canister of mass $m=0.40 \\mathrm{~kg}$ slides across a horizontal frictionless counter with speed $v=0.50 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$.

When the canister is momentarily stopped by the spring, by what distance $d$ is the spring compressed?", "1.2", "Okay, so I need to figure out how much the spring gets compressed when the canister hits it. Let me start by recalling what I know about springs and energy.\n\nThe problem says the canister is sliding on a frictionless surface, so there's no energy loss due to friction. When it hits the spring, the spring compresses, and the canister slows down until it stops. At that point, all the kinetic energy of the canister should have been converted into potential energy stored in the spring. That makes sense because energy is conserved here\u2014no friction, so mechanical energy is conserved.\n\nSo, the kinetic energy of the canister before hitting the spring should equal the potential energy stored in the spring when it's compressed by distance d. Let me write that down.\n\nKinetic energy (KE) is (1/2)mv\u00b2, and spring potential energy (PE) is (1/2)kd\u00b2. Since all the KE is converted to PE, we can set them equal:\n\n(1/2)mv\u00b2 = (1/2)kd\u00b2\n\nHmm, okay. Then I can solve for d. Let me rearrange the equation.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the 1/2:\n\nmv\u00b2 = kd\u00b2\n\nThen divide both sides by k:\n\nd\u00b2 = (mv\u00b2)/k\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n\nd = sqrt( (mv\u00b2)/k )\n\nWait, let me check that again. Starting from:\n\n(1/2)mv\u00b2 = (1/2)kd\u00b2\n\nYes, so if I multiply both sides by 2, I get mv\u00b2 = kd\u00b2. Then solving for d:\n\nd = sqrt( (mv\u00b2)/k )\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nNow plug in the numbers. The mass m is 0.40 kg, velocity v is 0.50 m/s, and spring constant k is 750 N/m.\n\nLet me compute the numerator first: mv\u00b2.\n\nm = 0.40 kg\n\nv = 0.50 m/s\n\nSo mv\u00b2 = 0.40 * (0.50)^2\n\nCalculate (0.50)^2 = 0.25\n\nThen 0.40 * 0.25 = 0.10\n\nSo numerator is 0.10 kg\u00b7m\u00b2/s\u00b2\n\nDenominator is k = 750 N/m\n\nSo (mv\u00b2)/k = 0.10 / 750 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 0.10 divided by 750.\n\n0.10 / 750 = 0.0001333...\n\nWait, 750 * 0.0001333... = 0.10. Let me check:\n\n750 * 0.0001 = 0.075\n\n750 * 0.0000333... = 0.025\n\nSo 0.075 + 0.025 = 0.10. Yes, so 0.0001333...\n\nSo (mv\u00b2)/k = 0.0001333...\n\nThen d = sqrt(0.0001333...) \n\nWhat's the square root of 0.0001333...?\n\nLet me convert 0.0001333... to scientific notation. 0.0001333... = 1.333... \u00d7 10^-4\n\nSquare root of 1.333... \u00d7 10^-4 is sqrt(1.333...) \u00d7 10^-2\n\nsqrt(1.333...) is approximately 1.1547 (since sqrt(1.25)=1.118, sqrt(1.333)=~1.1547)\n\nSo 1.1547 \u00d7 10^-2 = 0.011547 meters\n\nWait, 0.011547 meters is 1.1547 centimeters.

I need to find the measure of angle BOC in triangle ABC where OB and OC are the angle bisectors of angles B and C, respectively. And angle A is given as 110 degrees. Hmm, angle bisectors... right.\n\nFirst, I remember that in any triangle, the sum of the angles is 180 degrees. So, if angle A is 110\u00b0, then the sum of angles B and C must be 180\u00b0 - 110\u00b0 = 70\u00b0. So, angle B + angle C = 70\u00b0.\n\nNow, OB and OC are the bisectors of angles B and C. That means angle OBC is half of angle B, and angle OCB is half of angle C. So, angle OBC = (1/2) angle B, and angle OCB = (1/2) angle C.\n\nIf I add those two together, angle OBC + angle OCB = (1/2)(angle B + angle C) = (1/2)(70\u00b0) = 35\u00b0.\n\nNow, looking at triangle BOC, the sum of the angles should be 180\u00b0. So, angle BOC + angle OBC + angle OCB = 180\u00b0. We already found that angle OBC + angle OCB is 35\u00b0, so angle BOC = 180\u00b0 - 35\u00b0 = 145\u00b0.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If angle A is 110\u00b0, then angles B and C add up to 70\u00b0. Each bisected, so their halves add up to 35\u00b0. Then angle BOC is 180 - 35 = 145\u00b0. So the answer should be C) 145\u00b0.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Sometimes there are different formulas for angles formed by angle bisectors. Let me recall. There's a formula that says angle BOC = 90\u00b0 + (1/2) angle A. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, if angle A is 110\u00b0, then 90 + 55 = 145\u00b0. Oh, that's the same result. So that formula gives 145\u00b0, which matches my previous calculation. So that's a good check.\n\nLet me verify that formula. In triangle ABC, with angle bisectors of B and C meeting at O, then angle BOC = 90\u00b0 + (angle A)/2. Let's see why.\n\nSince angle B + angle C = 180\u00b0 - angle A. Then angle OBC + angle OCB = (angle B + angle C)/2 = (180\u00b0 - angle A)/2 = 90\u00b0 - angle A/2. Then angle BOC = 180\u00b0 - (angle OBC + angle OCB) = 180\u00b0 - (90\u00b0 - angle A/2) = 90\u00b0 + angle A/2. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo angle BOC = 90\u00b0 + (110\u00b0)/2 = 90\u00b0 + 55\u00b0 = 145\u00b0. Yep, that's exactly what I got before. So the answer is 145\u00b0, which is option C.\n\nI think that's solid. Let me just make sure there's no trick here. The problem says \"two inner angle bisectors OB and OC\", so O is the incenter, right? Which is where all angle bisectors meet. So angle BOC is indeed calculated as 90 + half of angle A. So 110 divided by 2 is 55, plus 90 is 145. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be C.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the measure of \u2220BOC in triangle ABC, where OB and OC are the angle bisectors of \u2220B and \u2220C respectively, and \u2220A = 110\u00b0, we can use geometric properties of angle bisectors and triangle angle sums.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Use Triangle Angle Sum\nIn any triangle, the sum of the interior angles is always 180\u00b0.

Is it rubber? The problem says \"rubber spheres,\" so probably the green one is a rubber sphere. The other sphere is small purple, so it's not large. So only the green sphere is a large rubber sphere.\n\nNext, big shiny cylinders. The yellow cylinder is a cylinder. Is it shiny? Yes, because it's a shiny cylinder. The purple cylinder is a rubber cylinder (since it's purple and the problem mentions \"rubber\" for spheres, maybe the cylinder is rubber too). Wait, the problem says \"big shiny cylinders,\" so the yellow cylinder is big and shiny. The purple cylinder is probably rubber, so not shiny. So the yellow cylinder is the big shiny cylinder.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"big shiny cylinders.\" So the yellow cylinder is big and shiny. Are there any other big shiny cylinders? The gray cube is shiny, but it's a cube, not a cylinder. So only the yellow cylinder is a big shiny cylinder.\n\nSo subtracting the large rubber sphere (green) and the big shiny cylinder (yellow). Let's count the total number of objects first.\n\nOriginal objects:\n\n1. Green sphere (large rubber)\n2. Purple cylinder (large rubber)\n3. Yellow cube (large rubber)\n4. Gray cube (shiny)\n5.

The green sphere is large rubber. The small purple sphere is small, so not subtracted. So subtract 1 (green sphere).\n\nThen subtract all big shiny cylinders. The yellow cylinder is big and shiny. Are there any others? The purple cylinder is rubber, so not shiny. The gray cube is shiny but it's a cube, not a cylinder. So subtract 1 (yellow cylinder).\n\nSo total subtracted: 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nOriginal count: 6. Subtract 2, so 6 - 2 = 4.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's list each object:\n\n1.

So maybe I need to find the value of x first, and then plug it into that expression to get the measure of angle H.\n\nFirst, I remember that the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is given by the formula (n - 2) * 180 degrees, where n is the number of sides. Since it's a pentagon, n = 5. So the sum should be (5 - 2) * 180 = 3 * 180 = 540 degrees.

Then DB is the distance from D to B. So DB = DC + CB. Given CB = 4.0, DB = 7.0. So DC = DB - CB = 7.0 - 4.0 = 3.0. Since D is the midpoint of AC, then AC = 2 * DC = 6.0. So yes, AC is 6 cm. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but let me check if the order could be different. Suppose the points are arranged differently. For example, maybe D is between A and B, but C is somewhere else. Wait, the problem says D is the midpoint of AC, so AC must be a segment with midpoint D. So A and C are endpoints, with D in the middle. Then B is another point. The figure shows A---D---C---B. So yes, the order is A, D, C, B. So DB is the distance from D to B, which is DC + CB. So DC = DB - CB = 7 - 4 = 3. Then AC = 2 * DC = 6. So answer A.\n\nWait, but let me check if maybe the order is different. Suppose the points are A---C---D---B. But then D is the midpoint of AC, which would mean D is between A and C. So that can't be. So the order must be A---D---C---B. So yes, the calculation seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe DB is the distance from D to B, which could be DC - CB if C is between D and B. Wait, but CB is 4.0, so if C is between D and B, then DB = DC + CB. Wait, no. If C is between D and B, then DB = DC + CB. Wait, no. If D is left of C, which is left of B, then DB = DC + CB. Wait, yes. So if D is at the left, then C is to the right of D, and B is to the right of C. So DB = DC + CB. So DC = DB - CB = 7 - 4 = 3. Then AC = 2 * DC = 6. So answer A.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again. It says \"D is the midpoint of AC\". So AC is split into two equal parts by D. So AD = DC. Then, if DB = 7.0 and CB = 4.0, then since C is between D and B, DB = DC + CB.

Answer by typing a time word, not a number. It is (_) after eight.", "quarter", "Okay, let's see. The question is asking what time is shown on the clock, and it says it's (_) after eight. The choices are A to E.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the clock image. The clock has numbers from 1 to 12. The hour hand is pointing between 8 and 9, and the minute hand is pointing at 3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the hour hand is between 8 and 9, but the minute hand is at 3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the minute hand is pointing at 3, which is 15 minutes past the hour. Because each number on the clock represents 5 minutes. So 3 times 5 is 15. So the time would be 8:15.\n\nBut the question says \"it is (_) after eight.\" So after eight, meaning 8 o'clock plus some time. So 8:15 is 15 minutes after 8. Now, the options are about how to describe that time.\n\nThe choices are: (A) half, (B) quarter, (C) o'clock, (D) quarter to, (E) quarter past.\n\nWait, \"quarter past\" is 15 minutes past the hour, right? Because a quarter of an hour is 15 minutes. So 8:15 would be quarter past eight.\n\nBut let me check again. The hour hand is between 8 and 9. The minute hand is at 3, which is 15 minutes. So yes, 8:15. So the correct term is \"quarter past eight.\"\n\nLooking at the choices, (E) is quarter past. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Sometimes people confuse \"quarter past\" and \"quarter to\". \"Quarter past\" is 15 minutes past, \"quarter to\" is 15 minutes before the next hour. So if it's 8:15, that's quarter past eight. So yes, E is correct.\n\nLet me check the other options. A is half, which would be 30 minutes. B is quarter, which is a bit vague. C is o'clock, which would be exactly on the hour. D is quarter to, which would be 7:45. So E is the right choice.\n</think>\n\nThe clock shows the hour hand between 8 and 9, indicating it is after 8, and the minute hand at 3, which represents 15 minutes (a quarter of an hour).

First, we need to identify the tiny gray bicycles. Looking at the scene, there's a small gray tandem bike (tandem bicycle) which is tiny and gray. Now, is it on the left side of the brown metal sedan? The brown sedan is on the right side of the scene. The tiny gray bicycle is near the center-left. So, the position: left of the brown sedan would be the area to the left of that car. The gray tandem bike is to the left of the brown sedan, yes.\n\nNow, the question is: Is the number of tiny gray bicycles on the left side of the brown metal sedan greater than the number of things to the left of the tiny green bicycle?\n\nFirst, count the tiny gray bicycles on the left of the brown sedan. There's 1 (the gray tandem bike).\n\nNext, count the number of things to the left of the tiny green bicycle. The tiny green bicycle is a road bike. Let's list all objects:\n\n- Red chopper (large)\n- Tiny red car (small)\n- Brown sedan (large)\n- Green road bike (tiny)\n- Gray dirt bike (large)\n- Gray tandem bike (tiny)\n\nNow, things to the left of the green road bike: let's see. The green road bike is on the left side. What's to its left? The gray tandem bike is below the green road bike, but is it to the left? Wait, the green road bike is a small bike. Let's check positions.\n\nAssuming the scene is arranged with the green road bike (tiny) at some position. Let's list all objects and their positions relative to the green road bike.\n\nThe green road bike is a small object. To the left of it would be objects that are positioned to the left of the green road bike's position.\n\nLooking at the scene:\n\n- The gray tandem bike is below the green road bike (since it's a tandem, maybe lower). Wait, maybe the green road bike is on the left side, and the gray tandem bike is to the left of it? Wait, no. Let's think again.\n\nWait, the green road bike is a small bicycle. Let's list all objects:\n\n1. Red chopper (large, left side)\n2. Tiny red car (small, middle)\n3. Brown sedan (large, right)\n4. Green road bike (tiny, left-middle)\n5. Gray dirt bike (large, center)\n6. Gray tandem bike (tiny, lower center)\n\nNow, the green road bike is a tiny bicycle. Let's find what's to the left of it. The red chopper is to the left of the green road bike? Wait, the red chopper is a large motorcycle. Let's see the positions.\n\nAssuming the scene is arranged with the red chopper on the left, then the green road bike is to the right of the red chopper. Wait, maybe the red chopper is at the top left, then the green road bike is below it? Wait, no, the green road bike is a small bike. Let's try to visualize:\n\n- Left side: red chopper (large), then green road bike (tiny) is to the right of the red chopper? Or maybe the red chopper is behind the green road bike.\n\nWait, maybe better to list all objects and their positions:\n\n- Red chopper: left side, large\n- Green road bike: left-middle, tiny\n- Gray dirt bike: center, large\n- Gray tandem bike: lower center, tiny\n- Tiny red car: middle, small\n- Brown sedan: right, large\n\nNow, the green road bike is a tiny bicycle. What's to the left of it? The red chopper is to the left of the green road bike? Let's check. If the green road bike is at position (x, y), then left of it would be x < green's x.\n\nAssuming the red chopper is at a lower x (more left) than the green road bike. So the red chopper is to the left of the green road bike. Then, the red chopper is a thing to the left of the green road bike.\n\nAre there any other things to the left of the green road bike? Let's see. The gray tandem bike is below the green road bike, but is it to the left? Maybe not. Let's count.\n\nThings to the left of the green road bike: red chopper (1), and maybe others? Wait, the gray tandem bike is below, so if the green road bike is at (x, y), the gray tandem bike is at (x', y'), where x' < x? Maybe not. Let's assume the green road bike is at position (2, 3), then left of it would be x < 2. The red chopper is at (1, 4), so that's left.

Rubber objects: bike, train, fighter jet (if they are rubber). So 3 rubber objects. 0 < 3, so yes.\n\nWait, the question is \"Are there fewer metallic fighters than rubber objects?\" So if metallic fighters count is less than rubber objects count, then answer is yes.\n\nLet's check the choices. The options are (A) Yes, (B) No.\n\nSo, if metallic fighters (let's say 0) < rubber objects (3), then yes. So answer A.\n\nWait, but maybe the train is metallic. Let's see: the train is blue.

Wait, let me check the actual graph.\n\nWait, the graph has the following data points:\n\nFor ditch:\n- racing: 80\n- afraid: 90 (since the bar goes up to 90)\n- grease: 90 (also up to 90)\n\nWait, but the y-axis goes up to 100. Let me check the exact values.\n\nLooking at the graph:\n\n- ditch: racing bar is at 80, afraid bar is at 90, grease bar is at 90. Wait, but the problem says \"more than 90 percent\". So 90 is not more than 90. So if a bar is exactly 90, it doesn't count.\n\nWait, the question says \"more than 90 percent\". So 90.01 or higher. So if any bar is above 90, then the object counts.\n\nLooking at each object:\n\n1. ditch:\n   - racing: 80 (below 90)\n   - afraid: Let's see. The bar for afraid in ditch is up to 90? Wait, the graph shows the top of the bar for afraid in ditch is at 90. Wait, but the y-axis is labeled \"Percent of People\", so each bar's height is the percentage. Let me check the exact values.\n\nWait, the graph has the following:\n\nFor ditch:\n- racing: 80 (since the blue bar is at 80)\n- afraid: the orange bar is at 90 (since the orange bar for ditch reaches up to 90)\n- grease: green bar is at 90 (reaches up to 90)\n\nWait, but the problem says \"more than 90 percent\". So 90 is not more than 90. So if the bar is exactly 90, it's not counted. So ditch's afraid and grease are both 90, which is not more than 90. So ditch doesn't count.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misreading the graph. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the graph's y-axis is from 0 to 100. The bars for ditch: racing is blue, up to 80. Afraid is orange, up to 90. Grease is green, up to 90. So all three are at or below 90. So ditch doesn't have any bar over 90.\n\nNext, \"want\":\n\n- racing: blue bar is at 20\n- afraid: orange bar is at 30\n- grease: green bar is at 10\n\nAll below 90. So no.\n\n\"homer\":\n\n- racing: blue bar is at 80\n- afraid: orange bar is at 90\n- grease: green bar is at 60\n\nAgain, afraid is 90, which is not more than 90.
